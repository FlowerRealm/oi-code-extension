## Project Overview and Technical Highlights

This extension aims to provide OI competitors with a consistent and reliable local development experience: by completely isolating compilation and execution from the host system through containers, avoiding issues like "compiler installation/environment inconsistency/path permissions," with the sidebar focusing on problem information management and operational workflow, and the testing system ensuring core functionality stability.
